# Lecture-12-CipherSchools
In this lecture i learned about the while loops and infinity loops and aslo learned about the the write hte code here is the basic definition of the is both and this is for do while A do-while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes the block as long as a given condition is true. The main characteristic of a do-while loop is that it checks the condition after the code block has been executed, ensuring that the code runs at least once.  and HERE WE GO  for infinity loops An infinite loop is a loop that runs indefinitely because the terminating condition is never met. This can happen if the loop condition always evaluates to true or if there is no condition to terminate the loop. and here is the simple code for both of them.
Well this is for while loop 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    while (true) {
        cout << "This will run forever!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

, here we go for infinity loop syntax code for infinty loop .
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
